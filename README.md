This is the new triaging application written in C/C++
The original was written in python, and can be found here: https://github.com/DomThePorcupine/triage
To use this application follow these steps:
	-Open a terminal
	-run 'git clone https://github.com/DomThePorcupine/triageC'
	-run 'cd triageC'
	-run 'g++ main.cpp -o crtdata'
	-run './crdata <opts>'
	-Be happy
Suggestions and or help are always welcome. This is a learning process for me and everyone involved!
