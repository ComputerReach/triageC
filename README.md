This is the new triaging application written in C/C++

The original was written in python, and can be found here: https://github.com/DomThePorcupine/triage

To use this application follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal
2. run 'git clone https://github.com/DomThePorcupine/triageC'
3. run 'cd triageC'
4. run 'g++ main.cpp -o crtdata'
5. run './crdata <opts>'
6. Be happy :)


Suggestions and or help are always welcome. This is a learning process for me and everyone involved!
